This is a kitchen alarm sensitive to smoke and flammable gases.

It uses MQ-5 and MQ-2 sensors.

The schematics (.dch) and PCB design (.dip) files can be opened with DipTrace.

LEDs give a sense about the amount of detected substance in air. I used them to determine what would the best position be for the sensor to detect the danger ASAP.
